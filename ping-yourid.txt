10 packets sent, 0 received, 100% packet loss
4. sydney.edu.au

Task 3.1.2:
There is no difference in minimum roundtrip time for all of these sites, with the exception of gaia that had all requests timed out. Sites 1, 3, and 4 are all university sites - they are all probably using eduroam as their internet hotspot provider (https://eduroam.org/). As for why I couldn't ping gaia: assumed that the website is designed to not respond to pings.
